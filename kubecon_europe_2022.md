# KubeCon/CloudNativeCon Europe 2022: Takeaways and Trends

I recently had the privilege of attending KubeCon / CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 (from here we'll just call it KubeCon) in Valencia, as well as GitOpsCon, one of the co-located events.

In this blog post I will outline my takeaways and trends that I have seen at the convention, and in the Cloud Native community.
These will be presented as a topics, in no particular order, and I will link to relevant talks from KubeCon, so that you can watch them yourself.
